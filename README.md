# Giphy-Homework

For my homework, I am creating a  giphy gif load page using Giphy's API and my custom API key to link the gifs to my personal sourse files. 

I need to link my API key, create a query url that I will use for my AJAX call. From the AJAX call, I will use jQuery to re-write my html file to upload and create buttons from the initial gifs, to whichever gifs the user inputs.
